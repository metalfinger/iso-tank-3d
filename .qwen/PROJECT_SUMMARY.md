# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive documentation for an ISO Tank 3D visualization project and resolve model hosting issues for proper web deployment.

## Key Knowledge
- Project uses Three.js for 3D visualization of an ISO Tank container
- Main technologies: Three.js, WebGL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Key files: `index.html`, `script.js` (main application), various 3D model files
- Models are in GLB and OBJ formats with associated material files
- Project includes PBR textures, HDR environment maps, and component timeline UI
- Current issue: SharePoint link doesn't work for direct model loading in web applications
- Models need to be hosted with CORS support and direct file access

## Recent Actions
- Completed comprehensive project documentation in `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Analyzed entire project structure including all folders and files
- Documented root directory files, alm folder (PBR textures), hdri folder (environment maps), images folder, models folder, and script folder
- Created clear explanations for non-technical and technical stakeholders about proper model hosting requirements
- Generated `SHARING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `TECHNICAL_EXPLANATION.md`, `PURAV_LAYMAN_MESSAGE.md`, and `PURAV_TECHNICAL_GUIDANCE.md` to address model hosting issues

## Current Plan
